1.  Explain the main sources of Data flood.
Ans: The sources of data flood cannot be specifically pointed because of the influence of the information and technology in the development 
     of science and technology. The data flood is the overflow of data from various sources that has to be normalized. There are countless 
     sources of data out of which the major sources are given below.
     
     The major sources of data floods are listed below:
     1. Stock Markets: Stock markets generate humungous data from the transactions being done throughout the day. 
     2. Social Networking: Social networking process large volumes of data such as photos, videos, information etc.
     3. Scienctific researches: Millions of Scientific journals are generated by research scholars all around the world in a month. This is a great source of data flood. 
     4. Medical developments: The greatest requirement of data and its processing is in the medical industry which accounts to many life-saving innovations.
     5. Management and Strategic analysis: The business and management of various institutions require data to analyse the trends and strategies in market and its scope.
     6. Astronomical data: Large volumes of data are collected in the process of analyzing the events that occur outside the earth. 
     7. Literature: The art and literature combinely form collosal volumes and variety of data which have to be stored.
     8. Defence and development logs: It is one of the major and the most important source of information that has to be secretly processed is Defence and development. Floods of data are received from D&D.
     9. Mail delivery systems: One of the major source of data flood is mails that are sent through internet. Logs generated consumes volumes of spaces.
    10. Telecommunication systems: Due to size of the human population there is a great flow of information and data. These logs produce collosal volumes of data. 


2. What is the difference between Data and Big data.
Ans:  Difference between Data and Big data is:
                 -> Data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables.
                 -> Big Data is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process 
                    using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.


3. What are main reasons behind hadoop becoming the solution for Data explosion.
Ans:  >The main reason behind hadoop becoming the solution for Data explosion is that Hadoop is an open source, Java-based programming framework that supports the processing of
        large data sets in a distributed computing environment. 
      >Hadoop provides a reliable, scalable platform for storage and analysis.
      >It works on the basis of Google File System or GFS
      >It has a distributed file system, called the Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS, which enables fast data transfer among the nodes 
      >It leverages a distributed computation framework called MapReduce.
